    "# Lecture 05: ELF and Program Anatomy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)**: common format for executable and library files on modern *nix systems\n",
    "\n",
    "All ELF files begin with a 'magic number' of 0x7F'E''L''F'\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sections**: organize binary into logical sections used by the linker and loaders. Some examples are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **.bss**: uninitialized data (global variables)\n",
    "- **.text**: code \n",
    "\n",
    "**Segments**: define the parts that should be loaded into memory and how\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```readelf``` command examines ELF file data\n",
    "\n",
    "- little endian: least significant bit is first\n",
    "- 2's complement: negative numbers\n",
    "- **entrypoint address**: where program will start running\n",
    "\n",
    "Process: instance of a running program. Provides each program with 2 key abstractions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- logical control flow\n",
    "- private address space\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual memory decouples address space from physical memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- can be larger than physical memory\n",
    "- not all pages need to be in physical memory to run a program (see page switching or mapping/un-mapping)\n",
    "- kernel is always mapped\n",
    "\n",
    "The stack grows from **top to bottom**\n",
    "\n",
    "The heap is dynamically allocated data accessed via ```malloc()```, ```calloc()```, ```realloc()```, ```free()```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the most significant bit is 1, then an address is kernel space. Else it is user/application space\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```/proc``` pseudo-filesystem exposes different aspects of running programs (memory layout of running processes)\n",
    "\n",
    "- global data in ```/bin/cat``` with r-w permissions\n",
    "- constant data in ```/bin/cat``` with w permissions\n",

    "## (Dis)assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "Intel x86 processor are **Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISCs)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- instructions may have variable sizes and formats\n",
    "- general purpose registers (EAX, EDI, ESP etc.)\n",
    "- instruction pointer/program counter (IP/PC)\n",
    "- important registers:\n",
    "  - ESP: stack pointer\n",
    "  - EBP: frame pointer\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 8 registers in 32-bit systems and 16 registers in 64-bit systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Assembly instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **push**: push word to stack\n",
    "- **mov**: move word\n",
    "- **imul**: signed multiply\n",
    "- **add**: add\n",
    "\n",
    "These base commands are combined with the datatype to be operated on. The operand therefore must match the size, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pushq: push quad word to stack\n",
    "- imull: signed multiply long\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory operands: parentheses indicate a memory operand. Each memory address can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Base + Index * Scale + Displacement\n",
    "- AT&T syntax: disp(base, index, scale)\n",
    "  - disp, index, scale are optional\n",
    "  - ex: -20(%rdx.%rdi,4) = rdx - 20 + (rdi*4)\n",
    "- ex: movl %edi, -20(%rbp): store %edi 20 below %rdp\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constants** (aka immediates) are defined using ```$``` and are in decimal unless:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0x prefix: hexadecimal\n",
    "- 0 prefix: octal\n",
    "\n",
    "Endianness (big/little) determines ordering:\n",
    "\n",
    "- big: least significant bit is last\n",
    "- little: least significant bit is first\n",
    "\n",
    "Load effective address:\n",
    "\n",
    "- leaq src,dest (set pointer and address something to it)\n",
    "  - src is address pode expression\n",
    "  - dest is set to address denoted by the expression\n",
    "- computing addresses without a memory reference:\n",
    "  - e.g. translate p = &x[i];\n",
    "- computing arithmetic expressions of the form x + k*y\n",
    "\n",
    "## Control Flow Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jumps**: sets the PC and redirects the control flow\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```jmp rel (jmp 0x6)```: rel can be 8, 16, or 32-bit intermediate\n",
    "  - relative jump to next instruction\n",
    "  - target = next instruction address + relative\n",
    "- ```jmp *%reg(jmp *%rax)```: absolute jump to the address in the register\n",
    "- ```jmp*(%reg)(jmp*(%rac))```: absolute jump to register\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional jumps**: sets the PC and redirects the control flow only if the condition is true\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```jle```: (jump less or equal)\n",
    "- ```jcc rel (jle 0x8)```: if condition is met, then jump to rel\n",
    "- normally preceded by compare instructions (e.g., if/else) or test instruction (```testq```)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calls**: calls function at the address\n",
    "\n",
    "**Returns**: returns from the current functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**nop**: not an operation (do nothing)\n",
    "\n",
    "**sal**: shift arithmetic left (multiply by 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediate (constant) jumps, conditional jumps, calls etc. use **relative addressing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory operations always use **absolute addressing**\n",
    "\n",
    "When loading addresses into registers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 32-bit systems: use constant\n",
    "- 64-bit systems: use RIP-relative addressing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disassembling\n",
    "\n",
    "Process of recovering assembly code of a binary. Various means to do so, such as the ```disas``` command of ```gdb``` and the ```objdump -d``` utility\n",
