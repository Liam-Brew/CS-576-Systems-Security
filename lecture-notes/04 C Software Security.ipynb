    "# Lecture 04: C Software Security\n",
    "\n",
    "C is an important language for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- very efficient\n",
    "- several other languages use C components\n",
    "- lots of legacy infrastructure is written in C\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **C**: compiler to machine code, typed but weakly enforced, low-level memory, user manages memory\n",
    "  - not memory safe: responsibility for securing memory falls to the developer\n",
    "- **Python/Perl/PHP**: dynamically and strong typed, interpreted, automatic memory management\n",
    "- **Java/C#**: type safe and strongly typed, automatic memory management, implicit memory access\n",
    "  - Java: compiles to byte code, run by the JVM. Initially interpreted and just-in-time translated\n",
    "  - C#: mix of compile and just-in-time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Vulnerabilities \n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatial Violations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Buffer overflows**: data is written outside a buffer's boundary (after the buffer)\n",
    "\n",
    "- commonly result from insufficient input checks, unchecked buffer size, and integer overflows\n",
    "- can happen through common functions such as strcpy(), strcat(), memcpy(), memset(), and memmove()\n",
    "-  may also happen using read(), fread(), gets(), fgets() etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Buffer underflows**: Opposite direction of overflows. Less common\n",
    "\n",
    "Off-by-one variation: writing outside boundaries of a buffer off by one byte\n",
    "\n",
    "Effects of over/underflows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- crash the app (DoS)\n",
    "- take over the app\n",
    "  - if remote: remote code execution\n",
    "  - else: arbitrary code execution\n",
    "- corrupt app state\n",
    "- leak sensitive data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format String Bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploits formatted output functions such as printf(), sprint(), snprintf() etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "- printf() is a variadic function, meaning that it accepts a variable number of arguments\n",
    "- the problem here revolves around the evaluation of the input string as a format string\n",
    "- the same result of overflows are possible, meaning that reading/writing arbitrary data from/to data is possible \n",
    "\n",
    "### Uninitialized Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a variable before initializing it with a value\n",
    "\n",
    "Vulnerabilities are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- uninitialized variable can contain stale program values\n",
    "- the value may be a stale value controlled by the attacker\n",
    "- much larger issue if what is controlled is a pointer\n",
    "  - function pointers especially are critical\n",
    "\n",
    "### Null Pointer Dereferences\n",
    "\n",
    "Happens when a null pointer (of address 0) is dereferenced\n",
    "\n",
    "Could occur when a variable is uninitialized or when a previously cleared variable is used \n",
    "\n",
    "Possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- depends is what is at address 0\n",
    "  - usually not allocated/mapped: app crashes\n",
    "  - otherwise: memory corruption\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use-After-Free (UAF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal violation that occurs when writing using a pointer that no longer points to a valid buffer\n",
    "\n",
    "- such pointers are called dangling\n",
    "- serious and hard to discover and defend against:\n",
    "  - become more complex due to threading and concurrency\n",
    "  - severity depends on the type of object that the dangling pointer points to\n",
    "  - as severe as other memory corruption errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Confusion\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is accessed using a pointer of the wrong type\n",
    "\n",
    "Type of pointer for casting determines what function to be called\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - pointers disguised as normal data is problematic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Segmentation fault**: when an attempt is made to access memory that either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- doesn't exist\n",
    "- that requires a higher tier of permissions than what is accessible\n"
